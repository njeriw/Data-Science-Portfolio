# Detecting Cybersecurity Threats: Deep Learning with Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing pipelines, Parital Dependence Plots
***
### Introduction 
This repository presents a deep learning solution for Cyber Threat Detection.

In today's evolving digital landscape, organizations face an escalating barrage of sophisticated cyber threats, from malware and phishing to denial-of-service attacks. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging the power of deep learning to identify malicious activities proactively.

Utilizing the BETH dataset, which simulates real-world network and kernel-process logs, this project focuses on designing and implementing a deep learning model to classify events as either benign (0) or malicious (1) based on the sus_label target. The preprocessed nature of the BETH dataset allows for a direct focus on model architecture, evaluation, and hyperparameter for effective threat identification.

By developing this model, the aim is to demonstrate proficiency in applying deep learning techniques to critical cybersecurity problems, ultimately contributing to more robust organizational defenses.
